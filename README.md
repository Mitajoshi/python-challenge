# python-challenge.

This assignment was very informative. I learned a lot of new things like:
    - how to clone a repo online and copy the same to my local machine github. 
    - how to read csv files into Python Code.
    - how to manipulate date into arrays/lists or dictionaries.
    - how to print data in a set desired format. 
    - how to write txt files from Python Code.
    - how to save all files in a particular manner as per the specific requirements. 
    - how to push folders from local repo on my machines onto my online repo. 

It was a lot of fun! Thanks for the opportunity.

P.S. I do not have a clue why each file got copied in duplicate, one original and one as a 'copy'.
