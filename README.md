# python-challenge.

## Overview
This assignment focusses on financial analysis and election data processing. Detailed statistical analyses were performed to realize key metrics for calculations of profit/loss and election outcomes.


## Purpose
The purpose is to apply Python scripting skills to real-world scenarios, reinforcing data manipulation, and analysis techniques. PyBank emphasizes financial metrics computation, while PyPoll focuses on processing election data, providing a practical avenue for participants to enhance their problem-solving skills in Python.

This assignment was very informative. I learned a lot of new things like:
    - how to clone a repo online and copy the same to my local machine github. 
    - how to read csv files into Python Code.
    - how to manipulate date into arrays/lists or dictionaries.
    - how to print data in a set desired format. 
    - how to write txt files from Python Code.
    - how to save all files in a particular manner as per the specific requirements. 
    - how to push folders from local repo on my machines onto my online repo. 

It was a lot of fun! Thanks for the opportunity.

P.S. I do not have a clue why each file got copied in duplicate, one original and one as a 'copy'.
